* 75-Day Holistic Bodyweight Muscle Gain Plan
  A structured, 75-day challenge built on Andy Frisella’s “75 Hard” framework,
  combining daily dual workouts (one indoors, one outdoors), strict nutrition,
  hydration, and mental resilience practices. This plan optimizes hypertrophy
  through progressive bodyweight and minimal-equipment routines, while leveraging
  sleep, diet, sun exposure, and cold therapy to naturally maximize testosterone.
  You’ll follow a 4:00 AM to 9:00 PM routine that balances muscle gain, programming
  study, family time, and recovery—all on a budget-friendly meal plan.

** Plan Overview
   - *Duration:* 75 days of consecutive adherence (no cheat meals, no alcohol,
     daily progress photos). [[1]]
   - *Dual Workouts:*
     - *Morning (4:00–5:00 AM):* Fasted bodyweight + dumbbell hypertrophy.
     - *Midday/Outdoor:* Second session: brisk walk, jog, or HIIT outdoors
       (builds mental toughness and sun exposure). [[2]]
   - *Daily Non-Negotiables:*
     - Follow a structured diet (eggs, mince, chicken, rice, pasta, maize meal).
     - Drink 4 L water.
     - Read 10 pages of nonfiction.
     - Take one progress photo. [[2]]

** Benefits of the Plan
*** Mental Toughness & Discipline
    The “75 Hard” rules push resilience and consistency, building grit transferable
    to all life areas. Participants report improved focus, self-confidence, and
    emotional resilience. [[3]]

*** Muscle Hypertrophy with Bodyweight
    Progressive overload via slow eccentrics, reps to failure, and variations
    (e.g., elevated push-ups, pistol squats) stimulates muscle growth comparably
    to weights when volume and intensity are high. [[4][5]]

*** Testosterone Optimization
    - *Exercise:* Resistance and HIIT boost endogenous testosterone. [[6][7]]
    - *Nutrition:* Adequate protein, healthy fats, zinc, magnesium, and
      vitamin D support hormone synthesis. [[8][9]]
    - *Lifestyle:* Early sun exposure, cold showers, and stress management reduce
      cortisol and favor T levels. [[10][6]]
    - *Sleep:* Consistent 7–9 hrs nightly is critical for hormonal recovery. [[8]]

*** Budget-Friendly Gains
    Core staples—eggs, ground meat, rice, pasta, maize meal, beans—provide a
    calorie-dense, protein-rich diet for ~3 000 kcal/day at minimal cost. [[11][12]]
