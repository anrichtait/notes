\section{Notes}

\subsection{What is the shell?}
The shell is a command line interface (CLI) that takes commands and passes them
to this operating system.\\\\

Bash is the most common example of a shell program, others include: ksh, tcsh
and zsh.\\

Most interactions with the shell are done through a terminal like gnome, alacritty
or kitty. \\

\textbf{NOTE:}Make sure that the last symbol of your shell prompt is not \#. If it is
this means that you are in sudo (super user) mode and this can be dangerous.

\subsection{Navigation}
Nothing much here for me to learn, maybe important to note thoguh:\\
Important facts about file names:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item File names that begin with a period character are hidden. This only means that ls will not list them unless we say ls -a. When your account was created, several hidden files were placed in your home directory to configure things for your account. Later on we will take a closer look at some of these files to see how you can customize our environment. In addition, some applications will place their configuration and settings files in your home directory as hidden files.

	\item File names in Linux, like Unix, are case sensitive. The file names "File1" and "file1" refer to different files.

	\item Linux has no concept of a "file extension" like Windows systems. You may name files any way you like. However, while Linux itself does not care about file extensions, many application programs do.

	\item Though Linux supports long file names which may contain embedded spaces and punctuation characters, limit the punctuation characters to period, dash, and underscore. Most importantly, do not embed spaces in file names. If you want to represent spaces between words in a file name, use underscore characters. You will thank yourself later.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Looking around}
\textbf{A closer look at the long format: ls -l}

\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ls}

\begin{itemize}
	\item File name: Name of file or directory
	\item Modification time: Last time the file was modifified
	\item Size: size of the file in bytes
	\item Group: Group that has file permissions other than the file owner
	\item Owner: The user that owns the file.
	\item File Permissions: A representaion of the file's access permissions.
		The first character is the file type, "-" indicates a regular or 
		ordinary file. A "d" indicates a directory. The second character represents
		the read, write and execution rights of the file owner. The third represents 
		the rights of the file's group. The last represents the permissions granted
		to everyone else.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}[c]{l|l}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Directory}} & 
		\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Description}} \\
		\hline
		\hline
		/ & The root directory where the file system begins.\\
		\hline
		/boot & Linux kernel and bootloader directory. The kernel is a file called vmlinuz.\\
		\hline
		/etc & Configuration files, important locations include: /etc/passwd - user info, /etc/fstab \\
			 & - mounted devices(disk drives), /etc/hosts - Network host names and IP adresses, /etc/init.d \\
			 & - system service scripts run at boot time.\\
			 \hline
		/bin, /usr/bin & Most of the system programs.\\
		\hline
		/usr & folders/files that support user applications\\
		\hline
		/usr/local & Used for installation of software (user). Most commononly in /usr/local/bin\\
		\hline
		/var & Files that change as the system runs, including logs and spools.\\
		\hline
		/lib & The shared libraries\\
		\hline
		home & user files\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The list goes on and on, do research to find specific files.

\subsection{Manipulating Files}
\textbf{Commands to know/understand:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item cp: copy files and directories
	\item mv: move or rename files and directories
	\item rm: remove files and directories
	\item mkdir: make directories
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Wildcards:}
Wildcards allow the user to specify groups of filenames. This makes mass file
manipulation much easier.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}[c]{l|l}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Wildcard}} & 
		\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Meaning}} \\
		\hline
		\hline
		* & Matches any characters \\
		\hline
		? & Matches any single character \\
		\hline
		characters & Matches any character that is part of the set characters.\\
		\hline
		!characters & Matches any character that is not a member of the set characters\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here are some examples of patterns and what they match.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}[c]{l|l}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Pattern}} & 
		\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Matches}} \\
		\hline
		* & All filenames \\
		\hline
		g* & All filenames that begin with the character "g" \\
		\hline
		b*.txt & All filenames that begin with "b" and end with ".txt"\\
		\hline
		Data??? & Any filename that begins with the characters "data" \\&followed by any other characters.\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Working with commands}
\textbf{Commands to know/understand}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item type: Display information about command type
	\item which: Locate a command
	\item help: Display reference page for shell builtin
	\item man: Display an on-line command reference
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What are "Commands"}\\
Commands fall into 4 categories:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Executable programs: programs that can be executed
	\item A command built into the shell: or "shell builtins. Like, "cd"
	\item A shell function: Miniature shell scripts.
	\item An alias: Commands that the user defines, built from other commands.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Shell permissions}
\section{Resources}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \href{http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php}{Permissions}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{man or help pages:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item chmod - modify file access rights
	\item sudo - enter super user mode or execute a command as such
	\item su - temporarily enter sudo mode
	\item chown - change file ownership
	\item chgrp - change a file's group ownership
	\item id - print effective user and group IDs
	\item groups - display current group names
	\item whoami - print effective username
	\item adduser - ?
	\item useradd - create a new user or update default new user info
	\item addgroup - ?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Permissions Notes}
Each file/directory is assigned access rights for the owner of the file, members
of a group of related users and everybody outside of the afore-mentioned groups.\\\\
Rights can be assigned to read, write and execute a file.\\\\

As an example the ls command will be used to look at the 'bash' program located in
the /bin directory:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ls-bin}
\end{center}

Here we can see:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The file "/bin/bash" is owned by user 'root'
	\item  The superuser has the right to read, write and execute
	\item The file is owned by the group "root"
	\item Members of the group 'root' can also read and execute
	\item Everybody else can read and execute the file
\end{enumerate}
Below is graphic showing what each portion of the first listing represents:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{permissions-one}
\end{center}

\section{Look at all the pretty commands}
\subsection{chmod}
Used to change the permissions of a file or directory. To use it specify the 
desired permission settings and the file or files that are to be modified.\\
There are two ways to do this, the following method uses the octal notation
method.\\\\

Think of the permission settings as a series of bits (like a computer):
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{octal-notation}
\end{center}
No we can represent each of the three sets of permissions, (owner, group and other)
as a single digit to create a convenient way of expressions the permission settings.\\\\

For example to set the permissions of a file to have read and write permission for the owner,
but wanted to keep the file private from others we would use:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{chmod-600}
\end{center}

\clearpage
\textbf{File Permissions:}\\
Below is a table of common settings for files, the ones starting with '7' are used with programs
since they enable execution. The rest are other kinds of files:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 777 - (rwxrwxrwx) No restrictions on permissions, All groups can do everythin. (BE WARNED)
	\item 755 - (rwxr-xr-x) File owner can read, write and exec, All others may read and exec.
	\item 700 - (rwx------) File woner can read, write and exec. Nobody else can do anything.
	\item 666 - (rw-rw-rw-) All users may read and write the file.
	\item 644 - (rw-r--r--) File owner may read and write, others can only read.
	\item 600 - (rw-------) Owner can read and write a file. All other have no rights.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Directory Permissions:}\\
The chmod command can also be used to change directory permissions.\\
In this case octal notation is also used but the r, w and x meanings
are different:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item r - Allows the contents of the directory to be listed if the x attribute is also set
	\item w - Allows files within the directory to be created, deleted or renamed if the x attribute is also set
	\item x - Allows a directory to be entered (cd dir)
\end{enumerate}
Here are some common settings for directories:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 777 - (rwxrwxrwx) No restrictions on permissions. Anybody may list files, create new files in the directory and delete files in the directory. Generally not a good setting.
	\item 755 - (rwxr-xr-x) The directory owner has full access. All others may list the directory, but cannot create files nor delete them.
	\item 700 - (rwx------) The directory owner has full access. Nobody else has any rights. This setting is useful for directories that only the owner may use and must keep private.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{chown}
Change file ownership.\\
Example:\\
Change the owner of some\_file from "me" to "you":
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{chown}
\end{center}

\subsection{chgrp}
Change the group ownership of a file or directory.\\
Example:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{chgrp}
\end{center}

	\item sort
	\item uniq
	\item grep
	\item tr
	\item rev
	\item out
	\item passwd (man 5 passwd)
\end{enumerate}

\section{I/O Redirection}
I/O redirection is another way of saying input and output redirection, specifically
how a user can redirect a command's output to a file, device and other commands.\\\\

\subsection{Standard Output Redirection}
Most command line program send their results to the standard output, by default 
the standard output directs it's contents to the display.\\\\

One way the user can redirect this standard output is by using the '>' characters.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
$ ls > file file_list.txt
\end{lstlisting}
In the above example the ls command is executed and the results are outputted 
to a file named file\_list.txt. Since the ls output was redirected to a file, no 
output will be displayed in the terminal.\\\\

In the above example every time the command is run file\_list.txt will be overwritten, 
we can append the output (add to end of file) by using two '>>' characters.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
$ ls  file_list.txt
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Standard Input Redirection}
Many commands accept input from something called standard input. Standard input 
can receive input from the Keyboard (via user in terminal) or from files (such as 
file\_list.txt) through redirection.\\
We can redirect standard intput from a file by using the '<' character:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
$ sort < file_list.txt
\end{lstlisting}
In this example the \textbf{sort} command is used to process the contents of 
the file. The 'sort' commands description is as follows: Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.\\
The output of this command will be sent to the standard output and displayed on
the terminal screen for the user to see. If you wish to send the sorted list to
another file it can be done like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
$ sort < file_list.txt > sorted_file_list.txt
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Pipelines}
Pipelines make it possible to feed the output of one command into the input of
another. Indeed creating some powerful capabilities. Example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
$ ls -l | less
\end{lstlisting}
This exampke shows how the ls command can be fed into the 'less' command. Essentially
creating a scrolling output.\\
\textbf{Some other examples to try}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ls -lt | head: Displays the 10 newest files in the current directory.
	\item du | sort -nr : Displays a list of directories and how much space they consume
		, sorted from the largest to smallest.
	\item find . -type f -print | wc -l : Displays the total number of files in the current
		working directory and all of it's subdirectories.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Filters}
Filters are frequently used with pipes to take input from one command and then 
output the result in standard output. This has a wide range of capabilities that
allow the user to process or search for specific information.\\
Some common filters include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item sort : sorts standard input
	\item uniq : removes duplicate lines of data
	\item grep : outputs ever line that contains a specified pattern of characters
	\item fmt : outputs formatted text
	\item pr : splits data into pages with page breaks, headers and footers (in prepartion for printing)
	\item head : outputs first few lines of input
	\item tail : outputs last few lines of input
	\item tr : Translates characters (upper/lower case conversion, change line termination characters)
	\item sed : Stream editor, more advanced text translations that 'tr'
	\item awk : An entire programming language designed for constructing filters.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} Chapter 6 of The Linux Command Line covers this in more detail. I have the book in the extra resources directory.\\
Alse consider reading more on \href{http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_adv_awk.php}{AWK}

\section{Special Characters}
In bash there is a concept of special characters, these are characters that 
carry out special instructions or have an alternate meaning. They are also 
known as \textit{meta characters} \\
Some common examples of special characters:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{special-characters}
\end{center}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
$ echo "I am $LOGNAME"
I am lhunath
$ echo 'I am $LOGNAME'
I am $LOGNAME
$ # boo
$ echo An open\ \ \ space
An open   space
$ echo "My computer is $(hostname)"
My computer is Lyndir
$ echo boo > file
$ echo $(( 5 + 5 ))
10
$ (( 5 > 0 )) && echo "Five is greater than zero."
Five is greater than zero.
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}


\section{The notes:}
\subsection{Expansions}
Any command that is entered into the command line goes through several 
processes before the result is output. Consider how much impact the "*" 
character can affect a command. This process is called expansion.\\\\

\textbf{Pathname expansion:}\\
The mechanism that makes wildcards work is called "pathname expansion". Consider 
how we can take the output of a normal 'ls' command and add a wildcard to it to 
display a different output.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
[me@linuxbox me]$ ls
Desktop
ls-output.txt
Documents Music
Pictures
Public
Templates
Videos
\end{lstlisting}
Examples of expansions in this context:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
[me@linuxbox me]$ echo D*
Desktop Documents
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
[me@linuxbox me]$ echo *s
Documents Pictures Templates Videos
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
[me@linuxbox me]$ echo [[:upper:]]*
Desktop Documents Music Pictures Public Templates Videos
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{2.5mm}

\textbf{Tilde expansion}\\
The "~" (tilde) character has special meaning in bash. It is used to specify 
the home directory. Without the tilde character we can also use "/home/" and 
"\$HOME".

\vspace{2.5mm}

\textbf{Arithmetic expansion}\\
You can use the command line as a calculator if you really want...

\vspace{2.5mm}
enumerate\textbf{Brace expansion}\\
Brace expansion is pretty powerful when used correctly.\\
Patterns to be brace expanded may contain a leading portion called a preamble 
and a trailing portion called a postscript. The expression can contain either a 
comma seperated list of strings or a range of integers/single characters. There 
can be no white space in the braces.\\\\

Below is an example of a great use for this sort of expansion:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
[me@linuxbox me]$ mkdir Photos
[me@linuxbox me]$ cd Photos
[me@linuxbox Photos]$ mkdir {2017..2019}-{01..12}
[me@linuxbox Photos]$ ls
2017-01 2017-07 2018-01 2018-07 2019-01 2019-07
2017-02 2017-08 2018-02 2018-08 2019-02 2019-08
2017-03 2017-09 2018-03 2018-09 2019-03 2019-09
2017-04 2017-10 2018-04 2018-10 2019-04 2019-10
2017-05 2017-11 2018-05 2018-11 2019-05 2019-11
2017-06 2017-12 2018-06 2018-12 2019-06 2019-12
\end{lstlisting}
This example shows a fast way to create a list of directories to store photographs 
or any other sort of file that needs to be date organized. 

\vspace{2.5mm}

\textbf{Parameter Expansion}\\
This will be covered more later.\\
For now just consider how variables in bash may be utilised.\\
This command will print all shell variables.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
printenv | less
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Shell Arithmetic}
As previously mentioned the shell allows arithmetic (use it as a calculator), 
this has wider implications when considering it's application to variables.\\
Arithmetic in the shell is the same for the most part as C, the list below is 
in order of their \href{https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/opprecedence.html}{presedence}. (AKA, what order they will execute in, sort of like 
shell's version of BODMAS)\\

\subsection{Variables}
Variables can are in uppercase characters by convention.\\
In bash there are two kinds of variables:\\

\textbf{Global Variables}\\
Variables that are available in all shells. These variables can be listed by 
using the 'env' or 'printenv' commands.\\\\

\textbf{Local Variables}
Local variables aare only available in the current shell. Use the 'set' command
 without any options to list these variables and functions.\\\\

 \textbf{Variables by content}\\
Variables can be further divided into four other groups according to their 
contents:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item String 
	\item Integers
	\item Constants
	\item Arrays
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Creating Variables}
Variables are case sensitive and by default declared in capital letters. 
Declaring a local variable in lower case letters is also acceptable but not 
neccessary. Basically follow your normal naming conventions with local variables
and think of global variables like constants in C.\\\\

\textbf{Syntax for declaring a variable}\\
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
#Global variable
VARNAME="value"
#Local variable
varName="value"
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Syntax for exporting variables}\\
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
export VARNAME="value"
\end{lstlisting}
Note that a child subshell can change variables locally not globally, any global 
changes need to be made where the variable was declared.\\\\

\textbf{Reserved Variables}\\
Just like C there are some keywords/variables that are designated by the language.
Therefore these variables cannot be changed.

\section{Shell initlialization files}
\subsection{System-wide config file}

\textbf{/etc/profile}\\
All settings that should apply to all user enviroment's should be set here. \\

\textbf{\~/.bashrc}
Useful file for creating aliases and adding applications to your path, it can 
also be used to autostart applications on Arch Linux.\\
Here is an example from my .bashrc file:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
eval $(starship init ion)
#ignore upper and lowercase when TAB completion
bind "set completion-ignore-case on"
### ALIASES ###
alias nv='nvim'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Change shell configuration files}
After making a change to any of the shell configuration files remember to either 
restart the system or source them.\\
This is done with the " source file\_name " command.

\section{Aliases}
Aliases provide a great way to create custom commands and shortcuts.

\subsection{Listing and creating aliases}
To list all the current aliases use the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
alias
\end{lstlisting}

Syntax for creating an alias:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
alias alias='command-to-run'
\end{lstlisting}

Here are some useful aliases in my config for example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,framexleftmargin=5mm,frame=single,xleftmargin=18pt]
#list
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
alias la='ls -al'
alias ll='ls -alFh'

## Colorize the grep command output for ease of 
##use (good for log files)##
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
\end{lstlisting}
