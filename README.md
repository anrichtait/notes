# Repo Description:
This repo is basically my school backpack, it contains all my digital notebooks (study related).

I created this repo to both keep all my notes saved somewhere and to share them with anyone interested.

# Explanation:
I write all my notes in Latex, obviously this can be tedious and take longer than hand writing them. 
Therefore I have made it easier in a couple of ways:
## The template:
I have created a template I use universally for all my notes. This makes it possible for me to copy the template
and rename the main .tex file to whatever notebook I am writing without having to worry about formatting and
packages. As such you will see that all my notebooks have math, japanese and programming capabilities.

## Gotta go fast:
To make common tasks (inserting code blocks, images and paragraphs, etc) quicker I have a custom library of snippets
I use that make these tasks almost instant. This is how I am able to write notes fast and on the fly.
I will include these snippets in my neovim config some time (maybe).

# The notebooks:
## C-Notebook:
I am currently studying Software Engineering and one of the focus languages is C, so this notebook is for that.

## Japanese Notebook:
Studying is hard but I find that spending time focused on something I enjoy is very important, so while I don't 
spend all my time on Japanese I do it as a passion project.

## Bash Notebooks:
Part of my software engineering studies. 

## Math Notebook:
This probably won't be updated often, due to me being a bit too busy right now to also study math.
I now have to different notebooks, the normal math and discrete math, this will soon be updated to include a linear algebra book as well.

## My study workflow: SQ3R
1. Create or enter the relevant notebook.
2. Open the relevant textbook.
3. Flip through each page of the chapter. Asses:
    - How long is the chapter?
    - What jumps out at you?
    - What should you expect from the upcoming chapter?
4. Check for a quiz at the end of the chapter.
    - This can give you an idea of what information to look for.
5. Start from the beginning of the chapter and read all the bold print.
6. Start from the beginning of the chapter and read the first and last sentence
of each paragraph.
7. Read the chapter and take notes.
    - When taking notes do your best to summarize the information.
    - Verbatim facts (understand the concept first) or mnemonics
    - Put concepts in your own words.
    - Write notes on the entire chapter and then do the excercises and examples. 
    This lets you check for holes in understanding.
